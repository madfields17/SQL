#In this SQL code, I was inspired by an app I was using during my winter vacation, Slopes, for skiing. I used similar data that I was collecting as I was skiing in this SQL code to mimic what the app was doing. 

CREATE TABLE slopes (id INTEGER, name TEXT, avg_speed INTEGER, vertical_distance INTEGER);
INSERT INTO slopes VALUES (1, "Madison", 15, 1.5);
INSERT INTO slopes VALUES (2, "Shane", 20, 2);
INSERT INTO slopes VALUES (3, "Caroline", 25, 1.9);
INSERT INTO slopes VALUES (4, "Emma", 10, 1);
INSERT INTO slopes VALUES (5, "Jack", 12, 1.8);
SELECT * FROM slopes;
UPDATE slopes SET avg_speed = 17 WHERE id=1;
SELECT * FROM slopes;
UPDATE slopes SET vertical_distance=2 WHERE ID=1;
SELECT * FROM slopes;
DELETE FROM slopes WHERE id=5;
SELECT * FROM slopes;
