#In this SQL code, I am querying to find information about 2 databases that hold varying data on Netflix shows/movies.

 
SELECT people.show_id, people.director, titles.title, titles.type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id;

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
ORDER BY title ASC;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT director FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id= people.show_id
WHERE titles.title= 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;

#6. What if we account for multiple movies that are the oldest movie?
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
