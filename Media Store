/* In this project I worked with a dataset called chinook, which represented a digital media store and included tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
*/


/*I showed a list of the Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. )
*/
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
LIMIT 10;

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers

/* I showed just the customers names from Brazil */
SELECT FirstName, LastName

/*I found the invoices of customers who are from Brazil */
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
