In this SQL I queried a database to answer various questions on orders placed on varying months.

/* I found how many orders were placed in January. */
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderid <> '' 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/* I found how many of those orders were for an iPhone. */
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product="iphone"
AND orderid <> '' 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*#I selected the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.*/

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM Bit_DB.customers cust; 

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderid
WHERE order_id <> '' 
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

/*I found the product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price was */
SELECT product, price FROM Bit_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

/* I found the total revenue for each product sold in January. */

SELECT sum(quantity)*price AS revenue, product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


/* I found which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue was. */
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;


/*I found how many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what the average amount spent for those customers was */
SELECT 
COUNT (distinct customers.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity * price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.quantity>2
AND order_id <> '' 
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

/* I listed all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and included how many of each were sold */

SELECT SUM(quantity), product 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

/* Here are some additional questions I answered with this database. */

/*Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
*/
SELECT distinct location , count (orderID)

GROUP BY location

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust

/*Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
*/
SELECT product,SUM (quantity * price)
