In this SQL I queried a database to answer various questions on orders placed on varying months.

#How Many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderid <> '' 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product="iphone"
AND orderid <> '' 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM Bit_DB.customers cust; 

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderid
WHERE order_id <> '' 
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, price FROM Bit_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;
