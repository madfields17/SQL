In this SQL I queried a database to answer various questions on orders placed on varying months.

#How Many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderid <> '' 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product="iphone"
AND orderid <> '' 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM Bit_DB.customers cust; 

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderid
WHERE order_id <> '' 
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, price FROM Bit_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT sum(quantity)*price AS revenue, product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;



#Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;


#How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
COUNT (distinct customers.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity * price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.quantity>2
AND order_id <> '' 
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold

SELECT SUM(quantity), product 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
